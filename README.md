TipR is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Thomas Clifford

Time spent: 8-10 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Added labels and icons to represent the dollar cost of splitting the check between 2, 3, and 4 people
- [x] Added custom launchscreen and changed UI design

## Notes

The main challenge of this excerise was figuring out how to use and unwrap optionals in Swift.  Additionally, 
figuring out how to use data from other views was challenging.
